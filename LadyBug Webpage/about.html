    Kelly lives in St. Phillip's, Newfoundland with her husband (Jarrod), daughter (Hope) and two cats (Max and Teddy).  Throughout her life she has admired ladybugs for their beautiful red and black coloring.  Ladybugs took on a different meaning in a hospital room 21 years ago.  It was a cold day in March (of course it's Newfoundland) when her son found a little ladybug had somehow found it's way into the room.  Worried that the ladybug would be hurt, the little boy picked up the ladybug and carried it to his Dad and asked if he could bring it outside.</p>

   <p>After that encounter, ladybugs in all forms found their way into her life.  Stuffed toys, magnets, cards, bookmarks everywhere there were ladybugs.  Upon finding out some of the meanings behind the ladybug, she unconsciously looked for them where she was.  To this day, if a ladybug lands on her or beside her, you will hear her whisper <span style= "font-style:italic">"Is that you, Ryan?".</span>   </p>
</p>
<p>These days Kelly can usually be found with her head into her laptop trying to get her HTML syntax to work properly for her.  This website was developed for her Front End Development Course.  Kelly took a different angle to this project and geared it towards children as her three great nephews (Huxley, Holt and Jamison) have recently moved in Newfoundland.  She hopes that they will enjoy reading her page and learning just a little more about ladybugs. </p>

<!-- 
1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? 3-4 hours research and 10+ hours on coding

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.) All online resources are listed in the Reference page

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. Not problems but did speak to Riley Hiron and Mitchel Joy regarding number of pages

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? One question to clarify who the webpage's audience was

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.  Yes I do think I could complete more difficult font-end development.  When i had difficulty remembering how to code or learning something new within the code (especially from the tags in the embedded files, that research and some help from AI solved any issues.  I found that the biggest difficulty I had was that the instructions were too broad and therefore I can trying to make my site more interesting for the audience.
