      Hello, young explorers! Today, we're going on an exciting journey to learn
      all about ladybugs, those adorable little creatures that bring joy to our
      gardens and fields. Get ready to discover their secrets and amazing life
      cycle!
    </p>

    <h3>What are Ladybugs?</h3>

    <p>
      Ladybugs, also known as ladybirds or lady beetles, are not actually bugs,
      but beetles! They belong to the Coccinellidae family 
      and are carnivorous, meaning they eat other insects.
    </p>

    
    <h3>Where Do Ladybugs Live?</h3>

    <p>
      The Two-Spotted Ladybug is found in the "Holarctic Realm", which includes
      North America, North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the South Arabian
      Peninsula, and Eurasia (except for Southeast Asia). They can be found in
      forests, rivers, trees, shrubs, gardens, fields, and sometimes even in our
      houses!

    <h3>How Many Types of Ladybugs Are There in Canada?</h3>

    <p>
      Did you know that there are over 553 different species of the common two-spotted ladybugs (the Adalia bipunctata which is there scientific name) around
      the world? In Canada, there are 59 species.  Newfoundland has 23 different types. Even in St. John's, you can find 6 different species
      of ladybugs!

      Ladybugs have soft bodies protected by hard outer shells that cover both
      their bodies and wings. The most common ladybug is red with  2 black
      spots. But they can also be <span style=color:black;font:bolder;font-size:larger>black</span>, <span style= color:yellow;font:bolder;font-size:larger>yellow </span>,<span style= color:brown;font:bolder;font-size:larger>brown</span>, or <span style= color:orange;font:bolder;font-size:larger>orange</span>. They can have
      anywhere from no spots up to 12 spots, or even bands and
      cross-hatched markings on their shells. As adults, they can grow up to
      3.5 to 5.2 mm in length
    </p>

<h3>What Do Ladybugs Do?</h3>

    <p>
      Ladybugs are nature's pest controllers! They eat insects that can destroy
      crops and plants in our gardens. Their favorite food is plant-eating insects like "APHIDS, which
      are insects like mealybugs and mites. Ladybugs have a huge appetite for
      these pests and help control infestations.
    </p>
   

    <h3>Are Ladybugs Harmful to Humans?</h3>

    <p>
      No, ladybugs are not harmful to humans. However, like many insects, they
      may emit a sticky, yellow, and stinky-smelling fluid as a defense
      mechanism when they feel threatened. This fluid can stain, but it's not
      dangerous.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      Ladybugs are fascinating creatures that play an important role in our
      ecosystem. They are beautiful, helpful, and fun to learn about. Remember,
      if you ever see a ladybug, be gentle and respectful, and enjoy the wonder
      of nature!
